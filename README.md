# Linear Regression from Scratch with Gradient Descent

This project demonstrates how to implement **Linear Regression** using **Gradient Descent** from scratch in Python.  
It covers the fundamental concepts of supervised learning, cost function (MSE), gradients, and parameter updates â€” all explained step by step in a Jupyter Notebook.
